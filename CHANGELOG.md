Complete rewrite

* Require PHP 8.1 or newer
* Changed namespace from `Awurth\SlimValidation` to `Awurth\Validator`

* Removed error groups, use `context` instead for a similar feature
* Merged the `request`, `array`, `object` and `value` methods into a single `validate` method

* Renamed `Awurth\SlimValidation\ValidatorExtension` to `Awurth\Validator\Twig\LegacyValidatorExtension`
* Moved validation logic to an `Asserter` class
* Added a `DataCollectorAsserter` to collect all data passing through the validator, not just invalid values, as an instance of `ValidatedValueCollection`
* Added `ValueReaders` to get values from array keys, object properties or request parameters
* Made all classes final while adding extension points for everything
